# Matching Initials: A Surprising Pattern in Spouse Names
This study investigates whether the initials of spousesâ€™ names might influence marital decisions, a topic not widely considered in previous research.

## <u>Full description</u>
The selection of a life partner is influenced by a complex interplay of sociological, psychological, and anthropological factors, ranging from emotional connection and social norms to cultural traditions. This study introduces a novel factor to the discourse: the matching of initials between spouses. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from the New York City Marriage Index, covering marriages from 1950 to 2017, we analyze the prevalence and statistical significance of this phenomenon. Our findings suggest a notable preference for partners with matching initials, revealing a subtle yet statistically significant pattern.
